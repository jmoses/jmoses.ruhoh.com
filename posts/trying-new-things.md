#### It's always important to try new things

So, I'm continually trying new "simple" blogging engines.  I did wordpress, tumblr, jekyll,
all that noise.  They all suck and are too complicated for the "I have the attention span of
a sparrow" developer in me.

Maybe ruhoh will be better.  It's like, Jekyll on crack, maybe.
